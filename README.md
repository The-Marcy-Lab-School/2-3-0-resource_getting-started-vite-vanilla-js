## Vite Overview

**Objective(s)**: Learn key terms used when discussing Vite. 

### What is Vite?

Vite is a tool for developing web applications. It helps developers by creating a **development version** of your project and providing a server for previewing and testing that version. In this "development" mode you can quickly iterate on the project and see the application **"hot reload"** without having to restart the server. 

When it is time to **deploy** your project, it can **compile** the project into a **production version** of the project. The production version can easily be deployed on a third-party **hosting service**, like Github Pages or Render,

> For basic front-end only applications, we'll use **Github Pages**. Eventually we'll use a more robust hosting service like Render which can provide a full back-end server and a database server.

### Why Use Vite?

Sure, you could build a project from scratch and manage your own "development" version and the "production" version. But **Vite is "lightweight"** (it doesn't slow down your process by using it) and the production version of your application will be **optimized for speed**.

**Vite is also quite versaitle**. It can be used for both simple and complex projects, from front-end only applications that use nothing but Vanilla JS to robust full-stack applications using frameworks like React.

## Setup

**Objective(s)**: Create a Github repo and the project starter code using Vite

First, create a Github repository and clone it down.

Inside the repo, create a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) project called `app` using the `npm create vite` command:

```sh
npm create vite
# > Project Name: app
# > Select a framework: Vanilla
# > Select a variant: JavaScript
```

This will create a folder in your repo called `app`. **This is your development version of the application.**

Then `cd` into the directory, install Vite dependencies and other dependencies for the project, and start the Vite development server:

```sh
cd app
npm i
npm run dev
```

At this point, you should be able to open up http://localhost:5173 to view the application. As you can see, Vite provides you with a simple counter application to get started. 

**TODO: Poke around and see if you can understand how the file structure is organized and how the application works, starting with `app/index.html`**

## Clean Up The Repo

**Objective(s)**: remove unwanted code from the provided files and organizee all code into a src/ directory

Clean up the directory by removing some of the provided code. Delete the `counter.js` and `javascript.svg` files and move the `main.js` and `style.css` files into a `src` directory.

```sh
rm counter.js javascript.svg
mkdir src
mv main.js src/
mv style.css src/
```

All future JavaScript and CSS files you create should exist somewhere within `src`. Feel free to create more folders if you'd like.

Edit the provided starter code:
* Empty out the `main.js` file (keep the `import './style.css'` line)
* Empty out the `style.css` file, keeping the styles you want to keep (I like to keep `:root`, `body`, `h1`, and `#app` styles but its up to you — you can start fresh).
* Edit the `<script>` tag `index.html` (line 11) so that it references the new location of `main.js`

To test that everything works, add some code to your `main.js` file...

```js
console.log("hello world");
document.querySelector("#app").innerHTML += '<h1>Hello world</h1>';
```

...and then reopen http://localhost:5173. 

Once you've confirmed everything is connected, go ahead and **commit and push**. Let's get started!

> 💡 **Tip**: You don't need to stop and start you Vite Development Server because it has "hot reloading". If you ever need to run it again though, use the command `npm run dev`
